# Introduction #

I have various code samples, I have done over several years.   I was tired not publishing these.   Sometimes they are worthless!   Sometime they could be used in your projects as is.
Most of these have been in Delphi, but sometimes I use other languages.

# What can I use? #

I am currently placing everything in the [SVN \trunk\](http://code.google.com/p/robstechcorner/source/browse/#svn/trunk) which may contain code that is in progress for an upcoming presentation or blog post.    However, you can use anything you want on this site.   Please leave any copyright notice I may or may not have placed in the code :-)  But, personally I hope you may be able to profit from the usage of some of this code.   If you are working on another open source project feel free to use the code, regardless of the license.   If you build a cool developer tool or utility with my code, I hope you would share a licensed copy with me, but you are not required.

If you modify something I have posted, and you think it's worthwhile to share then please send it to me and I will include it for others.
